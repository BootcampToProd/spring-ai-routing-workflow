## About This Project

This project implements an **E-commerce Customer Support System** as a real-world example of the Spring AI Routing Workflow. It showcases how to:

*   Set up a Spring Boot application with Spring AI.
*   Configure Spring AI to use Google Gemini (or other LLMs).
*   Implement the `SupportRoutingWorkflow` to intelligently classify and route customer inquiries.
*   Use LLM-powered analysis to determine the most appropriate support specialist.
*   Process inquiries with specialized prompts tailored for different support teams.
*   Handle diverse customer inquiries including order support, product questions, technical issues, and billing concerns.
*   Implement structured output parsing to extract routing decisions from LLM responses.
